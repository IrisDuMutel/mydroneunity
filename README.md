# mydrone

## This branch intends to be a simplification of the custom branch.
Drone simulation with realistic physics used to test Control and Navigation algorithms. 

The drone contains one approach to be controlled:

- We must use ForceSub.cs, which subscribes to the motor forces and does the transforms between right and left RFs. This approach is used together with a Simulink model that acts as control and navigation.
